Graphical xG

Graphical xG is a project designed to calculate, visualize, and analyze Expected Goals (xG) data in football, providing insights for analysts, coaches, and enthusiasts to better understand team and player performance.

Overview

The project focuses on calculating Expected Goals values and training advanced models to predict goal-scoring opportunities, enabling a graphical representation and comprehensive statistical analysis.

Key Components

xG Calculator (xg_calculator.py): Calculates the Expected Goals value for given match scenarios, utilizing relevant match data.

xGOT Training (train_xgot.py): Trains models to predict Expected Goals on Target (xGOT), improving prediction accuracy and performance analysis.

Features

Accurate xG Calculations: Precise calculation of scoring probabilities based on match events.

Advanced Modeling: Machine learning models to predict Expected Goals on Target (xGOT).

Visual Analytics: Graphically represents xG and xGOT data to easily interpret player and team performances.
